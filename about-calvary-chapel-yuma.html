                    <p><br>We are a fellowship of believers in the Lordship of Jesus Christ. Our greatest desire is to worship and magnify Him and to be conformed to His image through the work of the Holy Spirit. This is why we gather throughout the week for worship, prayer, communion, Bible study, and fellowship (Acts 2:42-47).<br> <br>We are not a denominational church, nor are we opposed to denominations, as such. We are opposed only to the emphasis of non-biblical teachings that divide the Body of Christ (Colossians 2:4,8; Galatians 1:6-10).<br> <br>We believe that the true basis of Christian fellowship is God's (agap√©) love, which is greater than our differences. Without His love we have no right to say we are Christians (1 Corinthians 13:1-13; Galatians 5:22-26).<br> <br>We believe worship of God should be spiritual. Therefore we remain flexible so the Holy Spirit may direct our worship.<br> <br>We believe worship of God should be inspirational. Therefore we give a great place to music in our worship.<br> <br>We believe worship of God should be intelligent. Therefore we emphasize Bible teaching in our services so God may instruct us how He should be worshiped.<br> <br>We believe worship of God should be fruitful. Therefore we look for His love in our lives as the greatest evidence that we are truly worshiping him.<br> <br>We believe the Bible is the Word of God inspired and without error in its original manuscripts. It is our only source of authority in matters of faith, conduct and truth.<br> <br>We believe God is one eternal King, personal and knowable, who manifests Himself in three distinct persons: God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit. He is worthy of our worship, confidence and obedience.<br> <br>We believe in the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ who is eternal, pre-existent Son of God. He willingly took on the body of a man, was virgin born, became our sinless substitute, shed His blood on the cross to completely pay for the atonement of our sins. We believe He died, was buried and resurrected in a literal body, ascended into Heaven, and is presently our Advocate and only High Priest.<br> <br>We believe the ministry of the Holy Spirit is to convict the lost, seal the believer and place him or her in the Body of Christ. The fruit of the Holy Spirit in one's life is love. We believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit but we do not believe that any special gift is necessary as evidence of salvation or of being filled with the Spirit.<br> <br>We believe every person is born spiritually dead with a sinful nature and cannot please God until Christ gives Him life. We believe salvation from sin, death and hell is solely by God's grace. It must be received by faith apart from any human performance or merit and is a free gift of God to anyone who personally place his confidence in the Lord Jesus Christ and His finished work on the cross. We believe that a truly born again person is secure in Christ.<br> <br>We believe in the resurrection of the saved and the unsaved; the saved unto the resurrection of life and the unsaved unto the resurrection of damnation.<br> <br>We believe that all believers should assemble in local churches for mutual edification, encouragement, evangelism, service and worship. Within our fellowship, as an act of obedience to the Word of God, we share our love of Christ through participation in the signs of the New Covenant: The Lord's Supper and the Baptism by immersion in water.<br> <br>We believe the Lord Jesus Christ will remove His Church, to meet them in the air, before the tribulation and before His millennial reign. But, He will physically return to earth to set up His kingdom for a literal one thousand-year millennial reign after the seven-year tribulation period.<br> <br>Thank you for reading.
