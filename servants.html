                    <p><span style="background-color: inherit;">Pastor Albert Garcia is the Senior Pastor of Calvary Chapel Yuma. Born in Southern California, and raised in Yuma. He has served in various ministries at Calvary Yuma since 2006, some of which include Children's ministry (Sunday School teacher and Administrator), street evangelism, leading and hosting Home Bible studies, and as the Assistant Pastor. In 2013, the Lord called Pastor Albert to be the Senior Pastor here at Calvary Yuma, Albert has faithfully stepped up to the plate. Our pastor teaches and preaches the Word of God in a unique expositional style (verse by verse &amp; point by point), those who are present during his messages will not leave without having been challenged by the Word of God. Pastor Albert Has been married to wife Cinthia since 2005 and are the parents of three wonderful kids, Jaquie  Albert Jr and  Arabella.</span><br> <br> <br>A &nbsp; &nbsp;W O R D &nbsp; &nbsp;F R O M &nbsp; &nbsp;P A S T O R &nbsp; &nbsp;A L B E R T<br> <br>       Before receiving Jesus as my Lord and Savior my life was consumed by gang activity, drugs, and alcohol.   The self destructive life that I chose to live was taking me nowhere. It wasn't until I was handcuffed in the back of a sheriff's car that I called out to God and said "Lord help me!"   I then ran for my life (new life I craved for) and escaped the law. Long story short, I absconded to San Diego, where I met my wife, came back to Yuma with her by my side, and turned my self in to the authorities.<br> <br>       I served my time in juvenile hall till my eighteenth birthday when i was released. Shortly after having our first child I was reminded of the fact that I needed to get right with God. I had been putting it off, but His Spirit had been convicting me. One day I got on my knees and cried out to God "Lord I can't do this, I can't be good, I'm not righteous, I want You to change me... I repent of my sins and ask that you come into my heart."  Ever since then, The Lord has been pruning me and conforming me to the image of His Son Jesus Christ. The Lord's work is ever present in my life. Whatever time you've spent or are currently spending in the world it has been too long. Has He been knocking on the door of your heart?  Invite Him in and allow Him to begin a good work in you.<br></p>
